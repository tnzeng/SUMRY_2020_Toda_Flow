# SUMRY_2020_Toda_Flow

We have created this repository to store the MATLAB programs used for the SUMRY 2020 Toda Flow REU, and the resulting research paper.
These were used to numerically search for bounded Jacobi operators stationary for the Toda Flow corresponding to a polynomial. The main polynomials of interest for these searches were quartics.
Also included is a difference equation calculator for examining the relations given by a Jacobi operator stationary for a polynomial.
